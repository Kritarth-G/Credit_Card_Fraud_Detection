# Credit Card Fraud Detection Project

This project uses machine learning to detect fraudulent credit card transactions from a public Kaggle dataset. The model pipeline includes EDA, feature engineering, and a comparison of three models: Logistic Regression (Baseline), Tuned Random Forest (Intermediate), and Tuned XGBoost (Advanced).

Installation


-> Git LFS is the essential tool for managing your large 150 MB creditcard.csv dataset, as standard Git cannot handle files exceeding 100 MB. Git LFS tracks the large file, stores its data separately from the repository, and commits only a small pointer to GitHub, keeping your project history fast and functional.

-> Clone this repository and install the required libraries using the `requirements.txt` file.




```bash
git clone https://github.com/prathamgalbale/Credit_card_fraud_detection
cd Credit_card_fraud_detection
pip install -r requirements.txt
```


-> run dataPreprocessing.py


-> run the required model




-> Also uploaded is the Jupyter file
