# Credit Card Fraud Detection Project

This project uses machine learning to detect fraudulent credit card transactions from a public Kaggle dataset. The model pipeline includes EDA, feature engineering, and a comparison of three models: Logistic Regression (Baseline), Tuned Random Forest (Intermediate), and Tuned XGBoost (Advanced).
